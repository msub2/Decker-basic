# Decker-basic
The Magick Spell powering the basic form of one of my future game NPCs.

It's programmed with some basic world knowledge about The Unseen City and one of its bars, Xanthum's Den, along with a short bio for Decker, the owner of Xanthum's Den.

## Notes on setup

Making the graph was easy, the hardest part was actually hooking Decker up to Discord, as recent changes in Magick had rendered the Discord integration broken when I went to test it. Thankfully it was a quick fix and I got it up and working the same day after figuring out how to enable some privileged intents I initially hadn't granted permission for.
